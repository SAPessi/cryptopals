# Cryptopals in Rust

Challenges from [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com) in Rust. I'm slowly going through all the exercises and learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) at the same time. I'll publish code here as I go along and clean it up. My objective is to complete all the challenges without relying on external crates.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SAPessi/cryptopals.git
$ cd cryptopals
$ cargo run

# you can also run the challenges as tests with
$ cargo test
```
