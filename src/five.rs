/// Given the length of the desired output and an original key as a byte slice
/// generates a `Vec<u8>` of the desired length populated with the key bytes
/// repeated in sequence. This function is used to generate keys for a

/// # Arguments
/// * `len` The desired output key length
/// * `key` The original key bytes
/// 
/// # Return
/// A generated key that repeats the give key bytes for the desired length.
